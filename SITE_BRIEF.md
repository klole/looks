# Looks -- Site Brief & Product Strategy

> Complete. Ready to build from.

---

## 1. Brand Foundation

### Brand Name
Looks
*(Domain: lookselevate.com -- "Lookselevate" is the domain, not the brand name)*

### Tagline / One-Liner
Elevate your appearance -- starting with your skin.

### Brand Story (2-3 sentences)
Looks helps men refine their appearance by improving skin quality at the source -- so your face looks sharper, healthier, and more confident over time. Not "fixing." Not "beauty." Refinement. Elevation. Baseline upgrade.

### Brand Voice & Tone

**Always:**
- Calm
- Precise
- Confident
- Understated

**Never:**
- Overpromise
- Use "glow," "radiant," or beauty cliches
- Shame the user
- Sound like TikTok skincare

> Think: men's grooming meets optimization culture, not influencer skincare.
> Internal rule: If it sounds like skincare TikTok would say it -- don't use it.

### Core Values
- **Refinement** -- Improvement through small, deliberate upgrades, not drastic change
- **Consistency** -- Results come from showing up daily, not chasing hacks
- **Honesty** -- No overclaims, no exaggerated timelines, no cosmetic fluff
- **Simplicity** -- One step, one focus, no unnecessary complexity
- **Quiet Confidence** -- Let results speak; no loud branding or hype

### Future Brand Platform
The brand is built to scale beyond a single SKU. Future product line potential:
- Recovery Cleanser
- Recovery Moisturizer
- Recovery System (bundle)

You're building a brand platform, not just selling a serum.

### Internal Mantra
> You don't need more products. You need better baseline skin.

## 2. The Product

### Product Name
**LookElevate · Recovery Serum**

No "copper." No "peptide." No buzzwords in the name. "Recovery" is the emotional win. "Serum" is familiar and non-threatening. Feels premium, restrained, and scalable.

Optional variants for future differentiation:
- LookElevate · Skin Recovery Serum
- LookElevate · Texture Recovery Serum
- LookElevate · Repair Serum

### What Is It? (Plain English)
A topical face serum formulated with GHK-Cu peptide (Copper Tripeptide-1). It's a recovery-focused serum designed to improve skin texture, fade lingering marks, and help your skin return to a sharper baseline. Fragrance-free. Lightweight. No gimmicks. Apply once daily after cleansing -- that's it.

### Product Category
Men's skincare -- skin recovery serum (post-acne / texture repair)

### Key Ingredients / Materials

**Hero ingredient: GHK-Cu (Copper Tripeptide-1)**
A naturally occurring peptide complex in the body that:
- Stimulates fibroblasts to produce more collagen and elastin
- Helps with the skin's repair mechanisms
- Improves skin thickness and elasticity (supported by controlled studies)
- Calms inflammation and helps regulate skin barrier proteins

**Supporting ingredients (likely):**
- Hydrating agents (hyaluronic acid or similar)
- Collagen boosters (standard for peptide serums)

**What it's proven to do (science context):**
- Boost collagen and elastin production
- Improve skin firmness and elasticity
- Reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles
- Improve overall skin texture and hydration
- Help with skin renewal and repair at a cellular level

> Improvements are gradual and depend on consistent application -- not a dramatic miracle product.

**Full Ingredient List (INCI-style):**
> Note: Mirrors standard GHK-Cu serum formulations. Final list should be confirmed with supplier before publishing.

Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Copper Tripeptide-1 (GHK-Cu), Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin

Fragrance-free. No essential oils.

### Price Point(s)

| Tier | Price | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Single** | $39 | One-time purchase |
| **2-Pack** | $69 | Most popular |
| **3-Pack** | $99 | Best value |
| **Subscription** | $34/mo | Save $5/delivery (Phase 2) |

> Pricing signals premium-but-accessible. Not drugstore, not luxury skincare.

### Product Differentiator
- Not "skincare" -- it's recovery. Supports the processes skin already uses to repair itself, just more effectively.
- Built for men who've handled the acne but the aftermath stuck around.
- One step, no routine overhaul. No complicated layering, no 12-step process.
- No beauty cliches, no cosmetic fluff. Just quiet optimization.
- Science-aligned ingredient (copper peptide), not random hype.
- Feels premium, not dropshippy. Avoids overclaim risk.

### Product Descriptions (Final -- Ready to Ship)

**Short description (above the fold):**
A recovery-focused serum designed to improve skin texture, fade lingering marks, and help your skin return to a sharper baseline.

**Long description (AG1-style: calm, confident, precise):**

Your skin handled the breakouts.
The aftermath didn't always fade.

The LookElevate Recovery Serum is built for men dealing with the after effects of acne -- uneven texture, lingering marks, and skin that never fully reset.

Instead of masking issues, it supports the skin's natural repair processes to help improve tone, smooth texture, and promote healthier-looking skin over time.

No fragrance.
No harsh actives.
No complicated routine.

Just consistent recovery.

**How it works (simple, credible, not nerdy):**

At the core of the formula is a naturally occurring copper peptide involved in skin repair and renewal.

This peptide supports collagen structure and skin resilience -- helping improve the appearance of texture and post-acne marks when used consistently.

The lightweight serum absorbs quickly and layers easily into a minimal routine.

**What to expect (expectation management builds trust):**

With daily use, men typically notice:
- Smoother-looking skin texture
- Gradual fading of old marks
- More even tone under real lighting
- Skin that looks healthier and more composed

This isn't an overnight fix.
It's a baseline upgrade.

**How to use:**
Apply once daily to clean, dry skin.
That's it.

**Who it's for:**
Designed for men who:
- Want visible skin improvement without cosmetic fluff
- Are past active acne but dealing with what it left behind
- Value refinement, not hype

## 3. The Customer

### Who Is the Ideal Customer?

Men who care about how they look but don't obsess over skincare. Want visible improvement without cosmetic fluff. Believe confidence is built through refinement, not shortcuts.

| Demographic | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Age** | 22-38 |
| **Income** | $50k-$120k |
| **Location** | United States, Canada, UK, Australia |
| **Lifestyle** | Works out or has in the past. Cares about appearance but avoids "beauty culture." Optimizer mindset (gym, nutrition, grooming, performance). |

### What Problem Are They Experiencing?

**Surface-level pain:**
- Acne scars that never faded
- Uneven texture that makes skin look "rough" in photos
- Jawline breakouts or redness that draw attention
- Skin that looks worse under harsh lighting

**Psychological pain:**
- "I look younger/less sharp than I should"
- "I've put work into my body, but my face didn't catch up"
- "I avoid photos / mirrors at certain angles"
- "I'd be more confident if my face matched the rest of me"

**Behavioral pain:**
- Tried random products with no visible change
- Doesn't want a 10-step routine
- Doesn't want something that feels feminine or cosmetic
- Wants improvement, not pampering

> Key insight: Men want quiet optimization, not beauty.

### What Have They Already Tried?

**Tried (and felt disappointed):**
- The Ordinary
- CeraVe (felt basic / maintenance-only)
- Random Amazon serums
- Multi-step routines that felt excessive

**Avoided:**
- Influencer skincare brands
- Overly clinical dermatologist brands with harsh actives
- Anything that feels feminine-coded

### What Does Their Life Look Like AFTER Using the Product?
With consistent use, men report:
- Smoother-looking skin
- Gradual fading of old marks
- Improved texture and tone
- Skin that looks more even under real lighting

The goal isn't perfection. It's elevation.

### Where Do They Hang Out Online?
- **Instagram** -- grooming, fitness, lifestyle content
- **TikTok** -- passive consumption, optimization content (not skincare creators)
- **Reddit** -- r/malegrooming, r/SkincareAddiction (lurkers, not posters)
- **YouTube** -- fitness, self-improvement, minimal grooming routines
- **Forums / Communities** -- gym culture, looks optimization spaces

## 5. Design Direction

### Visual Mood
- Clean
- Masculine-minimal
- Calm, neutral lighting
- Editorial, not "beauty"
- Performance-oriented without aggression

### Color Palette

> Core philosophy: Trust + restraint + refinement. Nothing loud. Nothing trendy. Everything intentional.

| Role | Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|------|-----|-------|
| **Primary** | Slate Blue | `#2F3E46` | Logo, headers, key UI elements. Trust anchor -- signals intelligence, science, calm authority. Masculine without being aggressive. The "AG1 green," just colder and sharper. |
| **Secondary** | Blue-Grey Mist | `#6C7A89` | Subheaders, dividers, secondary text. Softens the brand, adds depth without noise, keeps the site breathable and premium. |
| **Neutral Base** | Warm Off-White | `#F5F4F2` | Backgrounds, negative space. Feels human and skin-adjacent. Prevents the brand from feeling sterile. Makes product photography look expensive. |
| **Neutral Contrast** | Charcoal Ink | `#1E1E1E` | Body text, legal copy, fine print. Maximum readability, grounds the palette, serious professional tone. |
| **Accent (minimal)** | Muted Copper | `#B08D57` | Micro-accents only -- icons, separators, subtle highlights. Nods to copper peptides without saying it. Adds warmth and sophistication. |

> Rule: If you notice the copper, you're using too much.

### Typography Feel
- **Headers:** Modern serif or sharp humanist sans-serif
- **Body:** Clean sans-serif, high readability
- No scripts, no handwritten fonts, no stylized gimmicks
